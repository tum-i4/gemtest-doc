Frequently Asked Questions 
==========================

1. **Where is the source input data specified?**
    The source input data is specified in the **data** variable in the ``create_metamorphic_relation`` function.

2. **A metamorphic relation fails, but it should not. How do I know what went wrong?**
    Using the ``--html-report`` flag and using the web application can help visualize the metamorphic test case and assist in understanding what went wrong.

3. **How can I optimize the performance of my tests?**
    Consider various factors such as the input data size, the number of parameters, and the testing strategy. Consider using a sample testing strategy or reducing the input data size.

4. **Is there an example project I can refer to?**
    Yes, if you are looking for more detailed examples beyond the documentation, you can check the `gemtest-examples repository <https://github.com/tum-i4/gemtest-examples>`_ to see full implementations of various example test suites.
